# Introduction

TypeScript PDF is a modern TypeScript library for programmatic PDF generation that combines the power of type safety with a declarative, widget-based API.

## Overview

Unlike traditional PDF libraries that require extensive knowledge of PDF internals, TypeScript PDF provides a high-level, component-based approach similar to modern UI frameworks like React or Flutter.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Complete Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- Compile-time error detection
- Excellent IntelliSense support

### ðŸ§© Composition-Based Architecture
- Widget-based design using composition over inheritance
- Flexible and reusable components
- Easy to extend and customize

### ðŸ“± Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Works in both Node.js and browser environments
- Universal API across platforms
- No platform-specific dependencies

### âš¡ High Performance
- Constraint-based layout engine
- Layout caching for optimization
- Efficient PDF generation

### ðŸ“Š Rich Feature Set
- Text rendering with rich formatting
- Tables with advanced features
- Charts and data visualization
- Multi-page document support
- Theming and styling system

## Architecture

TypeScript PDF follows a dual-layer architecture:

1. **High-Level Widget API**: Declarative components for building PDF layouts
2. **Low-Level PDF Engine**: Direct control over PDF primitives when needed

This design provides both ease of use for common tasks and power for advanced use cases.
