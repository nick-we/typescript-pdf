# Current Context

## Current State

### **Project Status**: Initial Setup Phase
The typescript-pdf project is in its very early stages. The project repository has been created with:
- Basic `.gitignore` file (currently empty)
- Memory bank structure initialized for documentation
- dart-pdf source code available locally for reference (`dart-pdf/` folder)

### **Research Completed**
- **dart-pdf Analysis**: Comprehensive review of the source library structure completed
  - Identified dual-layer architecture: low-level PDF primitives + high-level widget system
  - Studied core components: Document, Widget system, Graphics, Fonts, Page management
  - Analyzed widget patterns: StatelessWidget, SingleChildWidget, MultiChildWidget
  - Reviewed PDF generation pipeline and layout algorithms
  - Examined Flutter-like declarative API patterns

### **Key Insights from dart-pdf**
- **Widget System**: ~35 widget types including Text, Container, Padding, Flex, Table, Chart
- **Layout Engine**: Constraint-based layout similar to Flutter with BoxConstraints
- **Graphics Layer**: Direct PDF canvas operations with transformation matrices
- **Font Handling**: TTF support, font metrics, text measurement, and fallback fonts
- **Multi-page Support**: Automatic page breaks and spanning widgets
- **Theming**: Centralized styling system with inheritance

## Recent Work

### **Memory Bank Initialization** (Current Session)
- Created comprehensive `product.md` with project vision and goals
- Documented target use cases and developer experience goals
- Established key principle: "Composition over Inheritance" as primary differentiator
- Defined success metrics for developer adoption and technical excellence

## Current Focus

### **Immediate Priority**: Complete Foundation Documentation
The current session is focused on establishing the complete project foundation through memory bank completion:

1. **Architecture Documentation**: Define system structure and component relationships
2. **Technology Stack**: Establish development environment and tooling decisions
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Create phased development approach
4. **Design Decisions**: Document key architectural choices and constraints

## Next Steps

### **Phase 1: Project Foundation** (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Package Setup**
   - Initialize npm package with TypeScript configuration
   - Set up development tooling (Jest, ESLint, Prettier, Rollup/Vite)
   - Configure build pipeline for multiple output formats (ESM, CJS, UMD)
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD

2. **Core Type Definitions**
   - Define base interfaces for Document, Page, Widget
   - Create geometry types (Point, Rect, Size, Matrix)
   - Establish constraint and layout system types
   - Define color, font, and styling type hierarchies

### **Phase 2: Low-Level PDF Engine** (Weeks 3-6)
1. **PDF Primitives**
   - Implement basic PDF document structure
   - Create page management system
   - Add graphics context and drawing operations
   - Implement font loading and text measurement

2. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Build constraint-based layout system
   - Create transformation and coordinate systems
   - Implement streaming output for large documents

### **Phase 3: Widget System** (Weeks 7-12)
1. **Base Widget Classes**
   - Implement Widget abstract base class
   - Create StatelessWidget and SingleChildWidget patterns
   - Build layout and paint pipeline
   - Add context and theming system

2. **Essential Widgets**
   - Text, Container, Padding, Align, Center
   - Row, Column, Flex layout widgets
   - Basic shapes and decorative elements

### **Blockers & Dependencies**
- **No immediate blockers identified**
- All necessary research materials (dart-pdf source) are available
- Clear technical direction established
- Development environment ready to be set up

### **Success Criteria for Current Phase**
- Complete memory bank documentation provides clear roadmap
- Architecture decisions support both simplicity and power user needs
- Technology choices enable cross-platform compatibility (Node.js + Browser)
- Implementation strategy balances rapid iteration with long-term maintainability

## Context for Future Sessions

When resuming work on this project:
1. **Memory Bank is Active**: All foundation documentation should be complete
2. **Next Action**: Begin Phase 1 implementation starting with package initialization
3. **Reference Materials**: dart-pdf source in `dart-pdf/` folder contains all implementation details
4. **Key Constraint**: Maintain "Composition over Inheritance" principle throughout implementation
