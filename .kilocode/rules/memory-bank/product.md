# Product Vision

## Project Purpose

**typescript-pdf** is a modern TypeScript library for programmatic PDF generation, providing a comprehensive solution that combines low-level PDF primitives with a high-level declarative API. It serves as a TypeScript port and evolution of the popular dart-pdf package, bringing PDF generation capabilities to the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem with improved developer experience.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. **Limited Modern PDF Generation in TypeScript**
- Most existing JavaScript PDF libraries are either too low-level (requiring extensive PDF knowledge) or too high-level (limited customization)
- Lack of comprehensive, type-safe PDF generation solutions in the TypeScript ecosystem
- Missing declarative, component-based approach to PDF creation

### 2. **Complex PDF Document Creation**
- Creating complex, multi-page documents with consistent styling is challenging
- Handling text layout, fonts, images, and graphics requires deep PDF expertise
- Responsive layouts and dynamic content generation is difficult with existing tools

### 3. **Poor Developer Experience**
- Existing libraries lack proper TypeScript support and type safety
- Limited composition capabilities and reusable components
- Verbose APIs that require extensive boilerplate code

## How It Works

### **Dual-Layer Architecture**
1. **Low-Level PDF Engine**: Direct control over PDF primitives (pages, fonts, graphics, colors)
2. **High-Level Widget System**: Declarative, component-based API similar to React/Flutter

### **Key Principles**
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Modular, composable design patterns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions  
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive APIs with excellent IntelliSense support
- **Performance**: Efficient PDF generation with minimal memory footprint
- **Flexibility**: Support both simple documents and complex layouts

## Target Use Cases

### **Primary Use Cases**
- **Report Generation**: Business reports, invoices, statements, analytics dashboards
- **Document Templates**: Form letters, certificates, legal documents
- **Data Visualization**: Charts, graphs, technical diagrams in PDF format
- **Multi-page Documents**: Books, manuals, documentation with complex layouts

### **Target Developers**
- **Full-stack developers** building web applications with PDF export needs
- **Node.js developers** creating server-side document generation services
- **Frontend developers** wanting to generate PDFs in the browser
- **Enterprise developers** building document management systems

## User Experience Goals

### **Simplicity for Common Tasks**
```typescript
// Simple document creation
const doc = new Document();
doc.addPage({
  build: () => new Text('Hello World', { fontSize: 24 })
});
```

### **Power for Complex Layouts**
```typescript
// Complex multi-column layouts with components
const doc = new Document();
doc.addPage({
  build: () => new Column({
    children: [
      new Header('Annual Report'),
      new Row({
        children: [
          new Chart({ data: salesData }),
          new Table({ data: financialData })
        ]
      })
    ]
  })
});
```

### **Type Safety Throughout**
- Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for all APIs
- IntelliSense support for properties, methods, and component hierarchies
- Compile-time error detection for invalid layouts or properties

### **Performance Characteristics**
- **Streaming Generation**: Support for large documents without memory issues
- **Incremental Rendering**: Generate pages on-demand for better performance
- **Tree-Shaking**: Modular architecture allowing bundle size optimization
- **Browser & Node.js**: Universal compatibility across JavaScript environments

## Success Metrics

### **Developer Adoption**
- Preferred choice for PDF generation in TypeScript projects
- Strong community engagement and contributions
- Integration with popular frameworks (Next.js, Express, etc.)

### **Technical Excellence**
- Comprehensive feature parity with dart-pdf while improving the API design
- Superior type safety and developer experience compared to existing solutions
- Performance benchmarks competitive with or better than existing libraries

### **Ecosystem Impact**
- Becomes the de facto standard for TypeScript PDF generation
- Enables new categories of applications requiring sophisticated PDF output
- Reduces barriers to building document-heavy applications in JavaScript/TypeScript
